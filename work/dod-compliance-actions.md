# Actions to Consider for DoD Compliance

This document outlines actions to take to ensure compliance with the Definition of Done. These are steps to be taken during development and before considering a release complete.

## Code Quality and Testing

1. Review and add unit tests for any new functionality in the `tests/` directory.
2. Search for and address any remaining `TODO` comments in the code.

## Documentation

3. Review and update docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules in the project.
4. Update README.md with any new features, dependencies, or usage instructions.
5. Add instructions for setting up and using pre-commit hooks to README.md.

## Functionality

6. Review `src/floridayvine/commands/` and `src/floridayvine/__main__.py` to ensure all CLI commands are properly implemented and integrated.
7. Review `src/floridayvine/persistence.py` for any new database operations and ensure they are tested.
8. Check `src/floridayvine/minio.py` for any updates and ensure related tests are in place.
9. Review `src/floridayvine/floriday/` for any updates and ensure related tests are in place.

## Performance and Security

10. Conduct a security review to ensure no sensitive information is hardcoded or logged.
11. Review and optimize database queries, ensuring proper indexing.
12. Evaluate large data operations and implement batching or streaming techniques where necessary.

## DevOps and Deployment

13. Review `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for any needed updates based on new dependencies or services.
14. Update `requirements-dev.txt` with any new development dependencies.
15. Increment the version number in `src/floridayvine/commands/version.py`.
16. Review and update `floridayvine-crontab` if there are changes to scheduled tasks.

## Cross-compatibility

17. Test the application in both development and production environments.
18. Review `pyproject.toml` for any new dependencies and ensure they are compatible with both Linux and macOS.

## User Acceptance

19. Schedule a demonstration of new features or changes with the product owner for approval.

## Release Preparation

20. Ensure all code and documentation are ready to be pushed to the central code repository.
21. Prepare release notes documenting new features, bug fixes, and any breaking changes.

These actions should help bring the project into compliance with the Definition of Done for the next release. Review and prioritize these actions as needed during the development process.
